### INTRODUCTION

#### Once during my years at university (MSc in Economics) I started to use R instead of software like SPSS etc. The main benefit of scripting in R for me is the clear arranged structure, the traceability of code and the superb handling of RStudio (my favourtie IDE for R). All R-scripts are written in R Studio but can be run cia CLI as well (plots are exported as png).


### BASIC INFO

#### This repository contains code written in R dealing with time series for the purpose of showing my skills and experience in coding with R. The data ifself was taken back in 2016 from Bureau of Economic Analysisi (BEA) for my own economic analysis. If more information about the actual data and theoretical framework of this analysis is needed, feel free to contact me (cause for the code itself it's not that imported I guess).


### DATA

#### The data is stored in the csv-file called timesSeries_R.csv (avaible in each folder).


### ACUTAL R CODE (IN SUBFOLDERS) FOR TIME SERIES ANALYSIS

#### timeSeriesBasic: timesSeries1.R basically imports the data needed from the csv-file, does one calculation, creates time series and plots them (saved as png).
#### timeSeriesAdvanced: timeSeries2.R starts with some advanced stuff. It runs a (not quite fitting) simple regression modell and plots the regression line (plots saved as png).
#### timeSeriesMoreAdvanced: coming soon!


### PREVIEW

#### More sophisticated code examples (actual time series analysis etc.) coming soon.
