Once during my years at university (MSc in Economics ... hell yeah) I started to use R instead of software like SPSS etc.
The main benefit of scripting in R for me is the clear arranged structure and the traceability of code. Just like this little example I uploaded:

The data itself is stored in the csv-file called R.csv.
The acutal R script imports the data needed from the csv-file, does some calculation, creates time series and plots the relevant results.
