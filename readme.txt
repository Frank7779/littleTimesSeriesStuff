Once during my years at university (MSc in Economics ... hell yeah) I started to use R instead of software like SPSS etc.
The main benefit of scripting in R for me is the clear arranged structure and the traceability of code. Just like this little example I uploaded:

The data was taken back in 2016 from Bureau of Economic Analysisi (BEA) for my own economic analysis (marxian theory meets modern data ...). If more information about the actual data is needed, feel free to contact me (cause for the code/script it's not that imported I guess).

The data itself is stored in the csv-file called timesSeries1_R.csv.
The acutal R script imports the data needed from the csv-file, does a calculation, creates time series and plots the relevant results.
