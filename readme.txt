INTRODUCTIION
Once during my years at university (MSc in Economics) I started to use R instead of software like SPSS etc.
The main benefit of scripting in R for me is the clear arranged structure, the traceability of code and the superb handling of RStudio (my favourtie IDE for R).
All R-scripts are written in R Studio but can be run cia CLI as well (plots are exported as pdf).

BASIC INFO
This repository contains code written in R dealing with time series for the purpose of showing my skills and experience in coding with R.
The data ifself was taken back in 2016 from Bureau of Economic Analysisi (BEA) for my own economic analysis (marxian theory meets modern data ... I saw you yawning!).
If more information about the actual data and theoretical framework of this analysis is needed, feel free to contact me (cause for the code it's not that imported I guess).

DATA:
The data is stored in the csv-file called timesSeries1_R.csv.

ACUTAL R CODE FOR TIME SERIES ANALYSIS:
The first R-script (timeSeries1.R) shows the very basic. It imports the data needed from the csv-file, does one calculation, creates time series and plots them.
The second R-script (timesSeries2.R) starts with some advanced stuff. It runs a (not quite fitting) simple regression modell and plots the regression line.

PREVIEW:
More sophisticated code examples (actual time series analysis etc.) coming soon.
