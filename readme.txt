Once during my years at university (MSc in Economics ... hell yeah) I started to use R instead of software like SPSS etc.
The main benefit of scripting in R for me is the clear arranged structure, the traceability of code and the superb handling of RStudio (my favourtie IDE for R).

This repository contains code written in R dealing with time series. The data ifself was taken back in 2016 from Bureau of Economic Analysisi (BEA) for my own economic analysis (marxian theory meets modern data 
...). If more information about the actual data and theoretical framework of this analysis is needed, feel free to contact me (cause for the code/script it's not that imported I guess).

The data itself is stored in the csv-file called timesSeries1_R.csv.

The first R script (timeSeries1.R) imports the data needed from the csv-file, does one calculation, creates time series and plots them (aif run via CLI exports them in one pdf-file).

More sophisticated code examples (actual time series analysis etc.) coming soon.
